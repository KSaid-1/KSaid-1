                                    <p>My main research interests are in observational cosmology, Large Scale Structure, and galaxy formation and evolution. I am currently working mainly on <a href="https://www.taipan-survey.org/">The Taipan galaxy survey</a>. The Taipan survey will measure redshifts for 1 million galaxies and Fundamental Plane distances and peculiar velocities for 100k galaxies in the local universe. It will be an order of magnitude larger than its ancestor the 6dF Galaxy Survey. Expected results from Taipan include the most accurate measurements of the present-day expansion rate of the universe (the Hubble constant), as well as the creation of the largest maps of density and velocity field of the nearby universe, and enable the testing of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Hubble’s constant will be measured to 1% precision using the baryon acoustic peak standard ruler. Measurements of peculiar velocities will be based on the Fundamental Plane distance indicator technique for early-type galaxies which will significantly improve our understanding of the observed dipole in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The Taipan survey will test Einstein’s general theory of relativity by measuring the growth rate of structure using two independent techniques; (i) Fundamental Plane based velocities, and (ii) redshift-space distortion. These measurements will drastically improve our knowledge about the Standard Cosmological Model, Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM). Furthermore, provide possible answers to the most fundamental questions about the universe such as: Why the universe is dominated by dark energy? What is the implicit distribution of dark matter in the universe? Why Einstein’s general theory of relativity breaks down on some cosmological scales?

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            The importance of the present-day expansion rate, or Hubble constant (H0), cannot be overstated: it is not only important for measuring distances in cosmology, its independent accurate determination is crucial for the next generation cosmological surveys, such as BigBOSS (Schlegel et al., 2011), LSST (LSST Science Collaboration et al., 2009), Euclid (Laureijs et al., 2011), and WFIRST (Green et al., 2012). Weinberg et al. (2013) stated that the efficiency of the Dark Energy Task Force (DETF1; Albrecht et al. 2006) will be raise by 40% if we have a 1% H0 measurement. Combining this 1% H0 measurement with measurements from these surveys will yield tight constraints on many properties of the universe, such as the curvature of the Universe today, the sum of neutrino masses, and the dark energy equation of state. The figure to the left (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014) shows the strong degeneracy between H0 and the curvature parameter today (ΩK), the sum of neutrino masses in eV (􏰃mv), and the dark energy equation of state (w0). It also shows how important an accurate model-independent H0 measurement in order to have tight constraints on many other cosmological parameters.
            Measurements of the H0 from the CMB temperature data at redshift z ∼ 1090, such as the Planck measurements in the Figure to the left involves strong assumptions about the standard cosmological model, ΛCDM. For example, the Figure to the left assumes a flat universe (ΩK = 0), baseline for the sum of neutrino mass (􏰃mv = 0.06 eV), and constant dark energy (w0 = −1). If the standard cosmological model ΛCDM is the right model to describe our Universe, the model-dependent and direct (standard candles) measurements should match. Significant deviation, will mean that either the ΛCDM is not the correct cosmological model for our Universe or one of these methods is wrong.
            Recently, a 2.4% local measurement of H0 = 73.24 ± 1.74 km s−1 Mpc−1 is found by Riess et al. (2016). This value increased the discrepancy with the model-dependent measurements from the Planck temperature data (H0 = 67.8 ± 0.9 km s−1 Mpc−1; Planck Collaboration et al. 2014, 2016) by 3.4σ.
            The Taipan survey will solve this discrepancy by obtaining more accurate (1%), and direct local measurement of the Hubble constant using an independent and robust method. In the next subsection I will describe this technique and how the Taipan survey will reach this (1%) accuracy.
            <div>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2 style="font-size:160%;">Method</h2>
            <div>
            The Taipan survey will use the baryon acoustic oscillation method to obtain a 1% measurement for the Hubble constant. These baryonic oscillations can be used as a standard cosmological ruler (Blake and Glazebrook, 2003). In the low-redshift universe, this technique can be use to obtain a direct, local, and less-dependent measurement of the H0 after calibrating the standard cosmological ruler. Beutler et al. (2011) used this method on the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) to obtain a measurement of Hubble constant of H0 = 67.0 ± 3.2 km s−1 Mpc−1. This measurement is the only local measurement aligns closely with measurements from Planck and WMAP. All other local measurements give higher H0 (Riess et al., 2011, 2016; Efstathiou, 2014).
            The precision of Beutler et al. (2011) measurement (4.8%) was not
            enough to solve the tension between the local measurements and the
            model-dependent measurements using the CMB temperature. Beut-
            ler et al. (2011) used the old setup of the Taipan survey (galaxies
            brighter than r = 17 mag) to determine that the Taipan will be able
            to constrain the Hubble constant to 3% precision. The new setup
            of the Taipan survey will include all galaxies brighter than r = 18
            mag instead of 17 mag. According to the final Fisher matrix this will
            increase the precision to 2%. At low-redshift, the baryon acoustic
            oscillation method can be sharpen more by reconstructing the linear
            density field (Eisenstein et al., 2007). According to the Taipan survey
            final simulations, these new setup and technique will allow H0 measurement with 1% precision.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            Galaxies have two components of velocity, the expansion velocity and the peculiar velocity which is the deviation from the smooth Hubble flow. Because this peculiar velocity arises as a result of gravity, it can be used as a tracer of the matter distribution, both luminous matter and dark matter. By measuring the peculiar velocity, the actual fluctuation in the mass and the logarithmic rate of the growth of the perturbations can be understood.
            In the last few decades, our understanding of the dynamics in the nearby Universe is increas- ingly being refined due to the advance of larger and more systematic surveys of peculiar velocities using either Tully-Fisher (TF) analyses such as Cosmic Flows (Tully et al. 2009; Courtois et al. 2011), the 2MASS Tully-Fisher Survey (2MTF: Masters et al. 2008, 2014; Springob et al. 2016),and 2MTF+ (Said et al., 2014, 2015, 2016a,b), or Fundamental Plane (FP) analyses such as 6dF (Magoulas et al. 2012; Scrimgeour et al. 2016). Despite all these efforts, the overall bulk flow resulting from these studies can still not be fully reconciled with the dipole observed in the CMB, nor is there consistency about the volume which gives rise to the bulk flow.
            The bulk flow is the average peculiar velocity over a sphere of a given radius R. The expected value of this measurement can be made by integrating over the power spectral. Assuming a ΛCDM model, the expected value for each X, Y, and Z Cartesian coordinates is v ∼ 100 − 110 km s−1. Therefore, one should expect a bulk flow amplitude of √3 × (100 − 110), which is 173 − 190 km s−1.
                Kashlinsky et al. (2008) used the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (Sunyaev and Zeldovich, 1972) and measured a very high bulk flow amplitude of 600 − 1000 km s−1 on a scale ≥ 300 Mpc h−1, which contradicts the expectation from the ΛCDM model. At the same time, Watkins, Feldman and Hudson (2009) used a new method, the minimal variance, to compile all major surveys (at the time) by weighting the peculiar velocities. They also found a large bulk flow amplitude of 407±81 km s−1 but one that arises from within a much smaller scale of 50 Mpc h−1. Surprisingly, both studies agree on the direction of the bulk flow, which suggest that either the ΛCDM model is wrong and we need to search for alternatives, or we live in a special place in the ΛCDM Universe.
                More recently, Hong et al. (2014) used the 2MTF survey and measured an amplitude of the bulk flow of 292 ± 28 for a volume of 40 Mpc h−1. Scrimgeour et al. (2016) used a much larger sample from the 6dFGS to measure a bulk flow of 248 ± 58 for a scale of 50 Mpc h−1, which is in excellent agreement with the ΛCDM model predictions.
                The main limitation is that these surveys do not reach far enough in terms of redshift to map the most massive overdensity in the local universe, the Shapley Concentration (Bilicki et al., 2011). The Taipan survey will reach twice as far as its ancestor the 6dFGS, which is far enough to map the effect of the Shapley Concentration and all other structures within the survey volume on the LG motion (Hopkins et al., 2014).

                The Taipan survey will adopt the FP method in their measurements of the distances. This FP relation describes the correlation between the luminosity, velocity dispersion, and the half-light radius of an elliptical galaxy. Although we have more TF spiral galaxies in the nearby universe, FP surveys for elliptical galaxies tend to probe deeper in redshift. Therefore, the FP relation was used for deeper peculiar velocity surveys such as the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS; Magoulas et al. 2012; Campbell et al. 2014; Springob et al. 2014; Scrimgeour et al. 2016).

                                        The discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe (Riess et al., 1998; Perlmutter et al., 1999) raised a lot of questions about the Einstein’s General Relativity (GR) theory. This cosmic acceleration can be explained within the GR theory by using a mysterious form of dark energy or a cosmological constant (Carroll, 2001; Peebles and Ratra, 2003). Another explanations is that this cosmic acceleration arises as a result of new gravitational physics (Freese and Lewis, 2002; Arkani-Hamed et al., 2002; Carroll et al., 2004; Chow and Khoury, 2009).
                                        One of the most important ways to test the Einstein’s
                                        GR theory, and other alternatives, is by measuring the growth rate of cosmic structure. These measurements can be done precisely through the analysis of the peculiar velocities of galaxies.
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <h2 style="font-size:160%;">Method</h2>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        The Taipan survey will measure the growth rate of cosmic structure through two independent and complementary methods: (i) the FP based peculiar velocities, and (ii) the effect of redshift- space distortion. These two methods complement each other because redshift-space distortion measurements are sensitive to scales of tens of Mpc, while peculiar velocity measurements can reach scales of hundreds of Mpc.
                                        The Taipan survey will provide the most valuable constraint on the growth rate of cosmic structure by combining the Taipan survey with the forthcoming Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) and its sister in the northern hemisphere, the Westerbork Northern Sky HI Survey (WNSHS) which will provide an HI survey of the whole sky (Duffy et al., 2012). The advantages of combining different peculiar velocity surveys are explored by Beutler et al. (2012) and more recently by Howlett et al. (2017) using Fisher matrix. Howlett et al. (2017) used the Taipan new higher number density with WALLABY+WNSHS and found a constraint on f σ8 to 3%. The Figure to the left shows the tight constraints that Taipan, along with WALLABY and WNSHS, will place on the growth rate.
